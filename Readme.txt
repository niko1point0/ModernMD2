This is an old method of animation from the 1990s game "Quake 2".
Here it is modernized to use GPU-based Vertex Interpolation, with fully static Vertex Buffers.

This method of animation requires a lot of memory; some uses of MD2 models may require 100mb of VRAM.

Only intended to be an intro tutorial. Skeletal Animation tutorials are coming soon
